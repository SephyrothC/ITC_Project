# Movie Recommendation System

The goal of this project is to create a system that recommends movies to a user based on their preferences. Here's how you might approach this project:

1. Data Collection

3. Model Training
4. Model Evaluation
5. Implementation
6. Continuous Improvement



## 1. Data Collection

You can use an existing dataset like MovieLens, which contains movie ratings given by users, as well as information about the movies themselves (like genre, director, etc.).

## 2. Data Preprocessing

Clean and prepare your data for model training. This might include handling missing values, transforming categorical variables into numerical variables, etc.

## 3. Model Training

Use a machine learning technique like matrix factorization or collaborative filtering to train your recommendation model. The idea is to discover patterns in user movie ratings, and use these patterns to predict what rating a user would give to a movie they haven't seen yet.

## 4. Model Evaluation

Evaluate the performance of your model using an appropriate measure like root mean square error (RMSE). You can split your dataset into a training set and a test set to do this.

## 5. Implementation

Implement your model in a web or desktop application where users can rate the movies they've seen and receive recommendations for new movies to watch.

## 6. Continuous Improvement

Once your system is in place, you can continuously update it with new data and retrain your model to improve its recommendations.
